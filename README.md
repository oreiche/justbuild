Justbuild is a generic build system supporting multi-repository
builds. A peculiarity of the tool is the separation between global
names and physical location on the one hand, and logical paths
used for actions and installation on the other hand (sometimes referred to as
"staging"). The language-specific information to translate high-level
concepts (libraries, binaries) into individual compile action is
taken from user-defined rules described by functional expressions.

## Getting Started

* The most simple way to build the `just` binary from scratch
  is `python3 ./bin/bootstrap.py`. For more details see the
  [installation guide](INSTALL.md).
