*justbuild* is a generic build system supporting multi-repository
builds. A peculiarity of the tool is the separation between global
names and physical location on the one hand, and logical paths
used for actions and installation on the other hand (sometimes referred to as
"staging"). The language-specific information to translate high-level
concepts (libraries, binaries) into individual compile actions is
taken from user-defined rules described by functional expressions.

Designated targets are taken entirely from cache, if the repositories
transitively involved have not changed. So, by making good use of
the multi-repository structure, the action graph can be kept small.
Remote build execution is supported and the remote-building of
cachable targets can be fully delegated to a service (provided by
the tool itself); when doing so, it is not necessary to have the
dependencies locally (neither as source nor as binary).

## Getting Started

* The most simple way to build the `just` binary from scratch
  is `python3 ./bin/bootstrap.py`. For more details see the
  [installation guide](INSTALL.md).
