/// @brief This class provides content-defined chunking for a file stream. It
/// allows to split a file stream into variable-sized chunks based on its data
/// content. In contrast to fixed-sized chunking, which splits a data stream
/// into chunks of fixed size, it is not prone to the data-shifting problem. In
/// order to assemble the resulting file, the delivered chunks have to be
/// concatenated in order.
///
/// A read buffer is used to progressively process the file content instead of
/// reading the entire file content in memory.
