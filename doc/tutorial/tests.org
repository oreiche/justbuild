* Creating Tests

To run tests with justbuild, we do /not/ have dedicated ~test~
subcommand. Instead, we consider tests being a specific action that
generates a test report. Consequently, we use the ~build~ subcommand
to build the test report, and thereby run the test action. Test
actions, however, are slightly different from normal actions in
that we don't want the build of the test report to be aborted if
a test action fails (but still, we want only successfully actions
taken from cache). Rules defining targets containing such special
actions have to identify themselves as /tainted/ by specifying
a string explaining why such special actions are justified; in
our case, the string is ~"test"~. Besides the implicit marking by
using a tainted rule, those tainting strings can also be explicitly
assigned by the user in the definition of a target, e.g., to mark
test data. Any target has to be tainted with (at least) all the
strings any of its dependencies is tainted with. In this way, it
is ensured that no test target will end up in a production build.

For the remainder of this section, we expect to have the project files available
resulting from successfully completing the tutorial section on /Building Hello
World/. We will demonstrate how to write a test binary for the ~greet~ library
and a shell test for the ~helloworld~ binary.

** Creating a C++ test binary

First, we will create a C++ test binary for testing the correct functionality of
the ~greet~ library. Therefore, we need to provide a C++ source file that performs
the actual testing and returns non-~0~ on failure. For simplicity reasons, we do
not use a testing framework for this tutorial. A simple test that captures
standard output and verifies it with the expected output should be provided in
the file ~greet/greet.test.cpp~:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unistd.h>
#include "greet/greet.hpp"

template <std::size_t kMaxBufSize = 1024>
auto capture_stdout(std::function<void()> const& func) -> std::string {
  int fd[2];
  if (pipe(fd) < 0) return {};
  int fd_stdout = dup(fileno(stdout));
  fflush(stdout);
  dup2(fd[1], fileno(stdout));

  func();
  fflush(stdout);

  std::string buf(kMaxBufSize, '\0');
  auto n = read(fd[0], &(*buf.begin()), kMaxBufSize);
  close(fd[0]);
  close(fd[1]);
  dup2(fd_stdout, fileno(stdout));
  return buf.substr(0, n);
}

auto test_greet(std::string const& name) -> bool {
  auto expect = std::string{"Hello "} + name + "!\n";
  auto result = capture_stdout([&name] { greet(name); });
  std::cout << "greet output: " << result << std::endl;
  return result == expect;
}

int main() {
  return test_greet("World") && test_greet("Universe") ? 0 : 1;
}
#+END_SRC

Next, a new test target needs to be created in module ~greet~. This target uses
the rule ~["@", "rules", "CC/test", "test"]~ and needs to depend on the
~"greet"~ target. To create the test target, add the following to
~greet/TARGETS~:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{ "greet":
  { /* ... unchanged ... */ }
, "test":
  { "type": ["@", "rules", "CC/test", "test"]
  , "name": ["test_greet"]
  , "srcs": ["greet.test.cpp"]
  , "deps": ["greet"]
  }
}
#+END_SRC

Before we can run the test, a proper default module for ~CC/test~ must be
provided. By specifying the appropriate target in this module the default test
runner can be overwritten by a different test runner fom the rule's workspace
root. However, in our case, we want to use the default runner and therefore it
is sufficient to create an empty module:

Create ~tutorial-defaults/CC/test/TARGETS~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ mkdir -p tutorial-defaults/CC/test
$ echo '{}' > tutorial-defaults/CC/test/TARGETS
#+END_SRC

Now we can run the test (i.e., build the test result):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ just-mr build greet test
INFO: Requested target is [["@","tutorial","greet","test"],{}]
INFO: Analysed target [["@","tutorial","greet","test"],{}]
INFO: Export targets found: 0 cached, 0 uncached, 0 not eligible for caching
INFO: Target tainted ["test"].
INFO: Discovered 5 actions, 3 trees, 0 blobs
INFO: Building [["@","tutorial","greet","test"],{}].
INFO: Processed 5 actions, 2 cache hits.
INFO: Artifacts built, logical paths are:
        result [359456b7b6a1f91dc435e483cc2b1fc4e8981bf0:8:f]
        stderr [e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391:0:f]
        stdout [21ac68aa0bceffd6d5ad49ba17df80f44f7f3735:59:f]
        time-start [c119fd0e22e79555f2446410fd90de4c091039d9:11:f]
        time-stop [c119fd0e22e79555f2446410fd90de4c091039d9:11:f]
      (1 runfiles omitted.)
INFO: Target tainted ["test"].
$
#+END_SRC

Note that the target is correctly reported as tainted with ~"test"~. It will
produce 3 additional actions for compiling, linking and running the test binary.

The result of the test target are 5 artifacts: ~result~ (containing ~UNKNOWN~,
~PASS~, or ~FAIL~), ~stderr~, ~stdout~, ~time-start~, and ~time-stop~, and a
single runfile (omitted in the output above), which is a tree artifact with the
name ~test_greet~ that contains all of the above artifacts. The test was run
successfully as otherwise all reported artifacts would have been reported as
~FAILED~ in the output, and justbuild would have returned the exit code ~2~.

To immediately print the standard output produced by the test binary on the
command line, the ~-P~ option can be used. Argument to this option is the name
of the artifact that should be printed on the command line, in our case
~stdout~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ just-mr build greet test --log-limit 1 -P stdout
greet output: Hello World!

greet output: Hello Universe!

$
#+END_SRC

Note that ~--log-limit 1~ was just added to omit justbuild's ~INFO:~ prints.

Our test binary does not have any useful options for directly interacting
with it. When working with test frameworks, it sometimes can be desirable to
get hold of the test binary itself for manual interaction. The running of
the test binary is the last action associated with the test and the test
binary is, of course, one of its inputs.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ just-mr analyse --request-action-input -1 greet test
INFO: Requested target is [["@","tutorial","greet","test"],{}]
INFO: Request is input of action #-1
INFO: Result of input of action #-1 of target [["@","tutorial","greet","test"],{}]: {
        "artifacts": {
          "runner.sh": {"data":{"path":"CC/test/test_runner.sh","repository":"just-rules"},"type":"LOCAL"},
          "test": {"data":{"id":"70769663e63241b9a30cb32d03b377374813ebd9","path":"test_greet"},"type":"ACTION"}
        },
        "provides": {
          "cmd": [
            "sh",
            "./runner.sh"
          ],
          "env": {
          },
          "may_fail": "CC test test_greet failed",
          "output": [
            "result",
            "stderr",
            "stdout",
            "time-start",
            "time-stop"
          ],
          "output_dirs": [
          ]
        },
        "runfiles": {
        }
      }
INFO: Target tainted ["test"].
$
#+END_SRC

The provided data also shows us the precise description of the action
for which we request the input. This allows us to manually rerun
the action. Or we can simply interact with the test binary manually
after installing the inputs to this action. Requesting the inputs
of an action can also be useful when debugging a build failure.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ just-mr install -o work --request-action-input -1 greet test
INFO: Requested target is [["@","tutorial","greet","test"],{}]
INFO: Request is input of action #-1
INFO: Analysed target [["@","tutorial","greet","test"],{}]

        /tmp/tutorial/work/test [e9fb451860442c37d6d84c01ce1c698597b88000:139088:x]
INFO: Target tainted ["test"].
$ cd work/
$ ./test
greet output: Hello World!

greet output: Hello Universe!

$ echo $?
0
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf work
#+END_SRC

** Creating a shell test

Similarly, to create a shell test for testing the ~helloworld~ binary, a test
script must be provided:

~test.sh~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
set -e
[ "$(./helloworld)" = "Hello Universe!" ]
#+END_SRC

The test target for this shell tests uses the rule
~["@", "rules", "shell/test", "script"]~ and must depend on the ~"helloworld"~
target. To create the test target, add the following to the top-level ~TARGETS~
file:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{ "helloworld":
  { /* ... unchanged ... */ }
, "test":
  { "type": ["@", "rules", "shell/test", "script"]
  , "name": ["test_helloworld"]
  , "test": ["test.sh"]
  , "deps": ["helloworld"]
  }
}
#+END_SRC

Similar to the binary tests, also for shell tests we need to provide at least an
empty module for the test rule defaults:

Create ~tutorial-defaults/shell/test/TARGETS~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ mkdir -p tutorial-defaults/shell/test
$ echo '{}' > tutorial-defaults/shell/test/TARGETS
#+END_SRC

Now we can run the shell test (i.e., build the test result):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ just-mr build test
INFO: Requested target is [["@","tutorial","","test"],{}]
INFO: Analysed target [["@","tutorial","","test"],{}]
INFO: Export targets found: 0 cached, 0 uncached, 0 not eligible for caching
INFO: Target tainted ["test"].
INFO: Discovered 5 actions, 4 trees, 0 blobs
INFO: Building [["@","tutorial","","test"],{}].
INFO: Processed 5 actions, 4 cache hits.
INFO: Artifacts built, logical paths are:
        result [7ef22e9a431ad0272713b71fdc8794016c8ef12f:5:f]
        stderr [e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391:0:f]
        stdout [e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391:0:f]
        time-start [9b4a96cc3b929d2909f74395d0317e93a59e621f:11:f]
        time-stop [9b4a96cc3b929d2909f74395d0317e93a59e621f:11:f]
      (1 runfiles omitted.)
INFO: Target tainted ["test"].
$
#+END_SRC

The result is also similar, containing also the 5 artifacts and a single runfile
(omitted in the output above), which is a tree artifact with the name
~test_helloworld~ that contains all of the above artifacts.

** Creating a compound test target

As most people probably do not want to call every test target by hand, it is
desirable to compound test target that triggers the build of multiple test
reports. To do so, an ~"install"~ target can be used. The field ~"deps"~ of
an install target is a list of targets for which the runfiles are collected.
As for the tests the runfiless happen to be
tree artifacts named the same way as the test and containing all test results,
this is precisely what we need.
Furthermore, as the dependent test targets are tainted by ~"test"~, also the
compound test target must be tainted by the same string. To create the compound
test target combining the two tests above (the test ~"test"~ from the current
module and ~["greet", "test"]~, i.e., the target ~"test"~ from the module
~"greet"~) add the following to the top-level
~TARGETS~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
{ "helloworld":
  { /* ... unchanged ... */ }
, "test":
  { /* ... unchanged ... */ }
, "all_tests":
  { "type": "install"
  , "tainted": ["test"]
  , "deps":
    [ "test"
    , ["greet", "test"]
    ]
  }
}
#+END_SRC

Now we can run all tests at once by just building the compound test target
~"all_tests"~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ just-mr build all_tests
INFO: Requested target is [["@","tutorial","","all_tests"],{}]
INFO: Analysed target [["@","tutorial","","all_tests"],{}]
INFO: Export targets found: 0 cached, 0 uncached, 0 not eligible for caching
INFO: Target tainted ["test"].
INFO: Discovered 8 actions, 5 trees, 0 blobs
INFO: Building [["@","tutorial","","all_tests"],{}].
INFO: Processed 8 actions, 8 cache hits.
INFO: Artifacts built, logical paths are:
        test_greet [7116c231e3a6da3d23b0549340d75d36a0a0c4ef:285:t]
        test_helloworld [c5a0d9fb4ba586d88dc5cddadedb6ddb670e95c4:283:t]
INFO: Target tainted ["test"].
$
#+END_SRC

As a result it reports the runfiles (result directories) of both tests as
artifacts. Both tests ran successfully as none of those artifacts in this output
above are tagged as ~FAILED~.
